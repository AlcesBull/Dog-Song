#My First Game Ever

This thing is gonna suck.

But honestly, for years I've told myself that I'm going to build a video game. I like graphic/visual design & illustration, and I enjoy coding a lot as well. I also really like to play video games, though my ability to do that is limited because of work, so these days it's mostly console (Switch & PS4).

Anyway, this is a silly attempt to make something that functions. It won't be awesome or beautiful or very cool, but thankfully gamemaker studio exists so I'm gonna give it a try.

Maybe in like a year or five I'll make something other people will enjoy. For now feel free to grab, fork, follow, or poke fun.
